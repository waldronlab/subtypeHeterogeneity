Validation and Clinical Relevance of (Ovarian) Cancer Molecular Subtypes

This project aims to resolve controversy around the clinical relevance of ovarian cancer subtypes by two main approaches.  First, subtype robustness and association to patient outcome are assessed by comparative meta-analysis using all relevant publicly available data. This will provide clarity on which definition of subtypes future research should focus on. Second, the likely ordering of subtype differentiation in tumor evolution is assessed, to establish whether subtype-specific treatments have any potential value. This proposal moves the clinical translation of ovarian cancer subtypes forward by resolving controversy around proposed subtypes using publicly available data, and by providing standardized definitions of subtype algorithms with documentation for their application to new patients.
