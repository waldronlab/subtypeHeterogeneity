Description: Testing of the hypothesis that expression-based cancer subtypes 
    tend not to be shared between intratumor clones, implying that they 
    differentiate late in tumorigenesis. This hypothesis will be tested first
    by identifying subtype-associated DNA alterations (copy number and somatic 
    mutations), then testing whether those alterations display greater intra-tumor
    heterogeneity than other alterations.
