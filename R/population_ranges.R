# Reciprocal overlap procedure
#

# reciprocal overlap (RO) approach (e.g. Conrad et al, Nature, 2010)
#
# reciprocal overlap of 0.51 between two CNV calls A and B:
#
# requires that B overlap at least 51% of A, 
#   *and* that A also overlaps at least 51% of B

# Approach:
#
# At the top level of the hierarchy, all contiguous bases overlapping at least 
# 1bp of a CNV call are merged into a “CNV region” (CNVR). 
# Within each CNVR we further define CNVs with the following algorithm:
#
# 1.   Calculate reciprocal overlap (RO) between all remaining calls.
#
# 2.   Identify pair of calls with greatest RO. If RO > threshold, merge and 
#       create a new CNV. If not, exit.
#
# 3.    Continue adding unclustered calls to the CNV, in order of best overlap. 
#       In order to add a call, the new call must have > threshold to all calls 
#       within CNV to be added. When no additional calls may be added, move to 
#       next step.
#
# 4.   If calls remain, return to 1. Otherwise exit.
#
# A typical reciprocal overlap threshold value is 0.5 for constructing CNVs


# given a set individual calls, returns overlaps (hits) between them 
# that satisfy the RO threshold
